    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
        I am an aspiring software developer who's become interested and motivated by the tech industry. 
        I've always been someone that enjoys using a computer and eventually took my curiosity to another level and did a Microsoft fundamentals entry-level course in mid-2022, which touched on C#, HTML, CSS, and relational databases mainly MySQL.
         Upon completion of this course, I realized that I enjoy web development and started a web development boot camp with the Appbrewery company. 
         I've currently completed the HTML section and moving my way through CSS and JavaScript. 
         Im extremely passionate about web and software development and I am looking to start and progress myself in the field. I am always willing to learn and see myself as a hardworking individual as I've been doing my studying while having a full-time job.
